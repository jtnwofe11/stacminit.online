     STUDENT TALENT AND CAREER MENTORING INITIATIVE (STACMINIT)
</h3>
<P>
   STACMINIT is an acronym as captured in the heading above. <br>It was birthed in 2018 after
    a very long incubation
    period by <b>Williams Obinna Nwofe</b> (WON ).
    <br>It is a twin foundation program aimed at providing the students in the
    tertiary
    institutions in <br>Nigeria with a twin opportunity of mentorship on the various
    career progression of their choice and nurturing of their various God-given
    talents.
    <br>This is done with the aim to encourage talent hatching amongst these students
    and a robust <br>encouragement on their career pursuit in order to know which of
    them that will better put food on
    <br>their table at their point of graduation.
</P>
     <h3>
            STACMINIT:</h3> <p>STACMINIT as an <b>NGO</b> is Africanized due to the peculiar problem it is trying to solve in the continent.
         <br>It is educational/ professional based foundation. Its aim is to curb the problem faced by a potential incoming student of
         the university and other <br>tertiary institutions over career choice making and bring to their knowledge,
         <br>the need to hacked to their talent which might even put better food on their table.
     </p>
<h3>MOTIVATION:</h3><p>Africa and Nigeria in particular show careless interest to talents, but adore paper qualification.
                                         <br>
                                         To this end, people hustle for paper qualifications by all means possibly abandoning their already perceived talents which they
                                         exhibit effortlessly.
                                         <br>Because of the quest to answer graduate, a lot of mushroom tertiary institutions have emerged
                                         <br>with half-baked graduates who can't
                                         compete favourably with their counterparts anywhere in the world. <br>Most of these graduates can only be useful to
                                         <br>Nigerian
                                         Labour Market
                                         <br>and not to the global market. These crop of graduates kill the economy of the country through corruption.

                                         <br>On the talent aspect, they would have successfully killed their talent where they left them to pursue academic careers.</p>
<h3>OBJECTION:</h3><P>To properly guide the students on the prerequisite technical know-how in career choice making that will activate
                                         <br>their full  interest in their choices of career.

To place careers and talents side by side for these students such that a better one can successfully feed them in future.
                                         <br>

To stand as a gap between these students <br>and the institutions in providing orientation to the vulnerable students which may appear
                                         marooned and naive to the working <br>of the tertiary institution.

To follow up on these students as they <br>progress in their career and talents to ensure adequate output.

To start up career and talent guide from <br>the secondary school to properly tame the observed destinies of these students to their
                                         <br>
                                         supposed destinations.

We provide legal and human right aids to <br>any mistreated student. This we do knowing that Nigerian tertiary institutions record
                                         <br>high degree of misconduct from lecturers and even fellow students.

In all, we provide mentorship <br>role to not only the in-coming students, but to the undergraduates.</P>
